© Unicorn.JS 2016-2017. Wrapper made by Alexandro Sánchez Bach.

Unicorn.JS uses the Unicorn framework, originally developed by Nguyen Anh Quynh, Dang Hoang Vu et al.
Check the repository for license details.

Unicorn.js is a port of the Unicorn emulator framework for JavaScript, done with Emscripten.

Unicorn is a lightweight, multi-platform, multi-architecture CPU emulator framework based on QEMU.
Developed by Nguyen Anh Quynh et al. and released under GPLv2 only.

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, version 2 of the License only.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

QEMU is licensed under GNU General Public License version 2.0 only.

The QEMU distribution includes both the QEMU emulator and
various firmware files.  These are separate programs that are
distributed together for our users' convenience, and they have
separate licenses.

The following points clarify the license of the QEMU emulator:

1) The QEMU emulator as a whole is released under the GNU General
Public License, version 2.

2) Parts of the QEMU emulator have specific licenses which are compatible
with the GNU General Public License, version 2. Hence each source file
contains its own licensing information.  Source files with no licensing
information are released under the GNU General Public License, version
2 or (at your option) any later version.

As of July 2013, contributions under version 2 of the GNU General Public
License (and no later version) are only accepted for the following files
or directories: bsd-user/, linux-user/, hw/vfio/, hw/xen/xen_pt*.

3) The Tiny Code Generator (TCG) is mostly under the BSD or MIT licenses;
   but some parts may be GPLv2 or other licenses. Again, see the
   specific licensing information in each source file.

4) QEMU is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard.
