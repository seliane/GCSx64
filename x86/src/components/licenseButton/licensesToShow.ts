      + 'price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n'

      + 'this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n'

      + '  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n'
      + 'anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n'

      + '  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n'

      + 'under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\n'

      + 'is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n'
      + 'Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n'
      + 'Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n'

      + 'source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n'
      + 'conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n'
      + 'copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n'

      + 'of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n'
      + 'distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n'
      + 'above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n'

      + '    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n'
      + '    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n'
      + '    parties under the terms of this License.\n'
      + '\n'
      + '    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n'
      + '    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n'
      + '    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n'
      + '    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n'
      + '    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n'

      + 'themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n'
      + 'sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n'
      + 'distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n'

      + '\n'
      + '    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n'
      + '    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n'
      + '    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n'
      + '    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n'
      + '    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n'
      + '\n'

      + 'making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n'
      + 'code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n'
      + 'associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n'
      + 'control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n'
      + 'special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n'
      + 'anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n'
      + 'form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n'
      + 'operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n'
      + 'itself accompanies the executable.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n'
      + 'access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n'
      + 'access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n'
      + 'distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n'
      + 'compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n'
      + '\n'
      + '  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n'
      + 'except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n'
      + 'otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n'
      + 'void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n'
      + 'However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n'
      + 'this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n'
      + 'parties remain in full compliance.\n'
      + '\n'
      + '  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n'
      + 'signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n'
      + 'distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n'
      + 'prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n'
      + 'modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n'
      + 'Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n'
      + 'all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n'
      + 'the Program or works based on it.\n'
      + '\n'
      + '  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n'
      + 'Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n'
      + 'original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n'
      + 'these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n'
      + 'restrictions on the recipients\' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n'
      + 'You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n'
      + 'this License.\n'
      + '\n'
      + '  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n'
      + 'infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n'
      + 'conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n'
      + 'otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n'
      + 'excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n'
      + 'distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n'
      + 'License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n'
      + 'may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n'
      + 'license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n'
      + 'all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n'
      + 'the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n'
      + 'refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n'
      + 'any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n'
      + 'apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n'
      + 'circumstances.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n'
      + 'patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n'
      + 'such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n'
      + 'integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n'
      + 'implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n'
      + 'generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n'
      + 'through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n'
      + 'system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n'
      + 'to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n'
      + 'impose that choice.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n'
      + 'be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n'
      + '\n'
      + '  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n'
      + 'certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n'
      + 'original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n'
      + 'may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n'
