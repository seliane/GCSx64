- Animated step by step execution of the CPU cycle and possibility to skip them each:
    - Get instruction
    - Execute instruction
    - Increment instruction pointer
- Detailed generic animations for basic x64 instructions
- Animated state changes 
- Visual representation of instruction, stack and base pointer in the memory
- Visual indication of bytes belonging to the current instruction or stack
- Visual indication of which memory bytes were accessed by the simulator
- Change log to keep track of past instructions and changes in register and memory values
- Code editor with syntax highlighting and assembler feedback
- Selection of demo programs
- Modern design
